      <h3>Play it Again! Use it Together</h3>
      <h3>Open Music Archive feat. 51 architecture</h3>

      <p>Victoria Gallery and Museum Liverpool<br/>
    14th September - 24th November 2018</p>

      <p>Eileen Simpson and Ben Whiteâ€™s project takes as its starting point the Institute of Popular Music (IPM) Archive of over 80,000 records, an exceptional and rich research resource, gifted over a number of years by collectors and enthusiasts.</p>

<p>With a particular focus on copyright-expired hit records from 1920s, 30s, 40s and 50s, the artists temporarily re-house the IPM archive in the public gallery - putting the archive on public view and making its contents available for public use.</p>

<p>The project explores ownership in the archive, investigating what is owned and how it is owned and promotes expanded usership of the archive through replay, live events, digitisation and distribution.</p>

<p>At the centre of the exhibition is a bespoke open source structure for archive digitisation, broadcast and remix performance, designed with 51 architecture. Animated by University of Liverpool students and graduates, the exhibition space is transformed into a production site where out-of-copyright sounds are ripped from archive records, to generate an evolving public resource. This resource is used as material for a series of public events with invited guests and collaborators.</p>
